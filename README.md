# Shell.txt
Shell.txt is a project that I created whilst messing around with the idea of creating an OS. Instead of doing this, I decided on creating a mini shell emulator that stored all memory in a text file!
## Usage
If you're on windows, consider running straight from the `.exe` file. Else, compile the `main.cpp` file and run from there.
## Syntax
All data is stored in `data.txt` which holds the main tree structure of the file system. Each "-" symbolises a level of depth in the file system and this is crucial for the program to decipher where each file and directory is located.
Files have an extension i.e. a dot (".") followed by some string. Directories, do not.
