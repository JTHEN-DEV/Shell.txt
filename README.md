# Shell.txt
Shell.txt is a project that I created whilst messing around with the idea of creating an OS. Instead of doing this, I decided on creating a mini shell emulator that stored all memory in a text file!
## Usage
If you're on windows, consider running straight from the `.exe` file. Else, compile the `main.cpp` file and run from there.
